### Objective

The objective of this challenges was to visualize a current savings portfolio and forecast the performance of that savings portfolio over 30 year and 10 year periods using a Monte Carlo simulation.

### Purpose

The purpose of this challenge was to determine if adjusting the risk appetite of a portfolio and the time held can produce have similar forecasted results.

### General Findings

Weighting the portfolio more heavily to stocks, at least in 20:80, will not allow the credit union members to retire after only 10 years. With a weighting of 40:60 over 30 years, there is a 95% chance that the portfolio will end within the range of  158636.36 ùëéùëõùëë 2200854.89 as opposed to 70315.11 and $ 136250.549998, respectively, with a weighting of 20:80 over 10 years. This makes sense as the power of compound growth is strong.
